<h2 id="the-foundations-of-legacy-understanding-estate-planning">The Foundations of Legacy: Understanding Estate Planning <a href="#the-foundations-of-legacy-understanding-estate-planning" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p><strong>Estate planning</strong> is not an exclusive concern of the wealthy; it is a fundamental aspect of responsible financial management for individuals of all walks of life. At its core, estate planning involves the strategic arrangement of one&rsquo;s assets and affairs to ensure their efficient and intended distribution in the event of incapacity or death.</p>
<h2 id="the-will-a-cornerstone-of-estate-planning">The Will: A Cornerstone of Estate Planning <a href="#the-will-a-cornerstone-of-estate-planning" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>At the heart of any estate plan lies the <strong>last will and testament</strong>—commonly referred to as the <strong>will</strong>. This legal document serves as a roadmap for the distribution of your assets, the appointment of guardians for minor children, and the nomination of an executor to manage your estate.</p>
<h3 id="key-components-of-a-will">Key Components of a Will: <a href="#key-components-of-a-will" class="anchor">🔗</a></h3><ol>
